* We researched different projects inside Mozilla
    * We found out about the [devtools-html][github] github organization
    * We found the [Gecko Profiler][gecko] plug-in and [perf.html][perf] front-end
* We selected a handful of bugs from the issue trackers under the devtools-html org
* We learned how to contribute code to the repo on IRC from other Mozilla developers
    * This includes a review process through MozReview
